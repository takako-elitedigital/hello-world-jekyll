      Chamomile tea is most commonly known for its calming effects and is frequently used as a sleep aid. <br />
      <br />
      In fact, studies show that it could improve sleep quality in older adults and postpartum women.<br />
      <br />
      What's more, chamomile is also believed to have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and liver-protecting effects.<br />
      <br />
      Other research also shows that chamomile could improve blood sugar control and ease symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
